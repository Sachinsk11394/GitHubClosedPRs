# GitHubClosedPRs
An example app to list all closed pull requests of all public git hub repositories of a user
Requests for closed pull requests on all repositories happen in parallel using coroutines
Only iteams which need update are updated on recycler view using diff utils


Future Improvements:
- Cleaner UI
- Change this project to "List all closed pull requests by current user"
- Group PRs with respect to users
